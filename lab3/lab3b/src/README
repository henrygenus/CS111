FILE SUMMARY:

    Makefile:       A Makefile with targets "default", "dist", and "clean"
    lab3b.py:       The main function testing the internal consistency of a .csv summary of a file system
    Block.py:       The implementation of the "Block" class used to keep track of block consistency
    Inode.py:       The implementation of the "Inode" class used to keep track of inode consistency
    constants.py:   A file which defines various constants for cleaner and more readable code


All .py modules involved in this program are written in python.  As is such, the default target for the Makefile \
    only creates a symbolic link to the file containing the main routine


FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:
    With very few tweaks, this program could be modified to check duplicate or invalid inodes, as well as multiple \
        file systems and/or groups at once.
