Per the spec:
    "In this project we will create applications that run in an embedded system, read 
    data from external sensors, and log the results. We will extend your embedded 
    temperature sensor to accept commands from, and send reports back to, a network 
    server. You will do this over both unencrypted and encrypted channels."

constants.h:	declarations of various constants to be shared with lab4 files

specB:	    	the spec for part B (the embedded system code)
4b_src/	    	the source code and documentation for the embedded system
main_b.c:	the main function looping between polling for commands and outputting 
		temperatures read by the BeagleBone
debug.h:	dummy declarations of mraa functions and constants used for debugging
debug.c:	dummy implementations of mraa functions and constants used for debugging
lab4b.c:        declarations of functions used by the main function
lab4b.c:	implementations of functions used by the main function

specC:		the spec for part C (the moderator between device and server)
4c_src/		the code for moderating interaction between device and server
main_c.c:	the main function that splits the process in 3 to mediate communication
		between the main_b device and the server
lab4c.h:	declarations of functions to be used by the above main function
lab4c.c:	implementations of functions to be used by the above main function

4a is included, but only exists to document setup of the BeagleBone.
It is currently missing an ifconfig result screenshot.
