This is a collection of assignments created for CS111 with Dr. Paul Eggert in fall 2019.

Lab2 seems to be untestable on my computer; I suspect multithreading is restricted.
As such there may be small errors, and *.csv's may be in a invalid state.

As I am not sure the canonical method for handling error messages, each project uses a
slightly different method.
